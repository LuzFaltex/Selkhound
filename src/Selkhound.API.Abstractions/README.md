# Selkhound.API.Abstractions

This package contains a complete set of type and API abstractions for the Selkhound API. It is used the official Selkhound Server and Client implementations. While this package does not provide any concrete implementations, it strives to act as a general, library-agnostic standard definition of the Selkhound API.

## Structure

The library is divided into type categories, organized in such a way to enable easy code browsing and separation of interests. Each object defined by Selkhound has a corresponding interface with inline documentation.
